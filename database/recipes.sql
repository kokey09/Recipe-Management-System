Three ripe bananas will give you about 12 pieces total. Prepare the jackfruit by slicing into strips.\r\nPrep your workstation by putting the dark brown sugar in a shallow plate, pre-peel the individual spring roll wrappers and cover them with a damp cloth, and place a water bowl next to your surface.\r\nBasic egg-roll technique: Place a spring roll wrapper in a diamond shape in front of you (one corner is at the top of your workstation, while another corner is facing the bottom). Take one banana slice and coat it lightly with the brown sugar, then place it about two inches from the bottom center. Take two to three strips of jackfruit and place it on top of the banana slice. Lift the bottom corner and cover the filling. Take the left and right corners and fold them towards the center. Finish rolling the entire turon upwards until you have about one inch left. Use your fingers to brush the top corner with water and complete the roll to seal. Repeat with the rest of the turon.\r\nOne-roll technique: Place a spring roll wrapper in a diamond shape in front of you. Take one banana slice and coat it lightly with the brown sugar, then place it about two inches from the bottom center. Take two to three strips of jackfruit and place it on top of the banana slice. Lift the bottom corner and cover the filling. Continue to roll upwards until you have one inch left of space. Use your fingers to brush the top corner with water and complete the roll to seal. Repeat with the rest of the turon.\r\nIn a pan wide enough to fit the width of your turon (this is important especially if you used the one-roll technique), fill enough vegetable oil (or other neutral oil) until it’s about two inches high. Heat your oil to 350 °F.\r\nWhen the oil is hot enough, carefully lower the turon into the oil. Deep fry for about one minute before turning over and cooking for another minute or until the turon is nice and golden brown. Remove the turon and place them onto a wire rack. Repeat with the rest of the turon.','static/recipes-img-table/toron.jpg',0,37);
