Shape pizza dough into a circle. Brush one side of dough with 2 teaspoons olive oil.\r\n\r\nCarefully place dough oil side down onto the grill over direct heat.

Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with butter and line the bottom with parchment paper.\r\n\r\nPeel (or leave skin on) and core apples; cut into cubes between 1/4 and 3/8-inch in size. A little smaller is okay, but if your cubes are any larger, they wonâ€™t get tender enough when baked.  Add to a large bowl and toss with apple cider vinegar.\r\n\r\nMix together flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl.\r\nIn another bowl, beat butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in 1 egg on high speed until it is fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Add the second egg and repeat. Mix in rum, vanilla extract, and 1/2 of the flour mixture.  When the flour disappears add the rest, and fold in with a spatula.\r\n\r\nFold in apples until evenly mixed into the batter. Transfer batter to the prepared pan, making sure all the batter is pressed in firmly. Smooth top and dust with remaining 3 tablespoons sugar.\r\nBake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nRemove cake from oven and let cool in the pan for about 30 minutes. Invert cooled cake onto a wire rack, place a serving plate on top, and flip back over. Dust top with powdered sugar and serve.','static/recipes-img-table/french-apple-cake-recipe-171299-2.jpg',0);
